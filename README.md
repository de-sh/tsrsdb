# TSrsDB
A WIP timeseries database written from scratch in rust-lang

TSrsDB is intended to be an experiment to understand if a timeseries database library can be written with minimum external dependencies.

## Contributing to this effort
I am doing this out of curiosity and as a learning exercise, you can contribute to thiseffort by pointing out where I or anyone learning about building such a service should be headed, by creating an issue to discuss your points from personal experience or in order to point out resources you feel would be awesome for beginners to checkout.

If you are here looking for a working/battle tested rust rewrite of a popular tsdb implementation, thank you for coming over, but this may not be the right repo. If you are interested in investing time/moeny into such an alternative or just want to figure out how this thing works, I will be using some of my time to build this out and would be happy to accept help to move ahead in this endeavour. For this you may contact me: [devdutt@outlook.in](mailto:devdutt@outlook.in).

## Licensing
I have plans to license this under the Apache License, Version 2.0, but in the mean time I intend to keep this just opensource for purposes of academic/educational reference, accepting no warranty or liability whatsoever.
